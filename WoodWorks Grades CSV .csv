Both sound and broken knots, heartwood and colour variation throughout boards allowed. 
No minimum of sapwood and filler; you should also expect end splits. Filler will be used and will complement the wood.

Genuine Reclaimed,"Allows for a virtually limitless size and number of knots, checks, colour variation and may contain sap. 
Character features can include nail holes and manmade imperfections from a previous life. 
"
Superprime,"Super Prime grade is the cleanest available, containing minimal knots, sap and colour variation, granting perfect synchronisation across every board and block. 
These boards are so crisp and clear, that only 1 in 1,000 makes it through the rigorous selection process for our Superfine collection. 
"
Quarter Sawn,"True quarter sawn Oak boards are cut so that the end grain is at an angle of 90 degrees to the face board. 
This produces wonderfully straight grained planks. Medullary rays (the iridescent streaks) are then visible as swirls running across the width of the board. 
The joinery in cathedrals, palaces and fine houses was produced from the finest quality quarter sawn Oak. 
"
Rift Sawn,"As per quarter sawn but with an angle of just under 90 degrees – producing mainly straight grained boards without the medullary rays. 
"
Exotic Wood,"Exotic wood is available in both Select and Clear grade. 
These grades are not the same as the standard Select grade already covered, as there are differences in the way that Exotic Woods are graded. 
Expect large colour variations between the heartwood and the sapwood.
