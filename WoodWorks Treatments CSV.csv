Surface Treatment Name,Surface Treatment Description
Carbonised ,"The painstakingly intricate process involved that pays homage to the ancient Japanese woodworking process of wood burning that results in Yakisugi, our combination of tradition and innovation. Boards used to manufacture these floors and panels are individually charred by flame in carefully controlled conditions to enable this unique surface effect. 
"
Fumed ,"Fuming timber, mainly European oak, is a process whereby the timber is exposed to large concentrations of ammonia gas for a period of up to 24 hours. This has the effect of darkening the tannins in the wood surface leaving new timber with a nicely matured base colour. This allows oak flooring to be finished in a wide range of coloured options that would not be possible with un-fumed material. 
The Fuming process only works on heart-wood and any naturally occurring sap in the oak will not significantly change colour.
"
Deep Fumed ,"Deep Fumed is the process of fuming wood for a much longer period than normal Fumed. A fuming process of up to 72 hours allows the fuming effect to penetrate even more deeply into the timber. This results in a much darker coloured wood than with normal Fumed.
The Fuming process only works on heart-wood and any naturally occurring sap in the oak will appear much lighter against the darkened areas.
"
Double Fumed ,"Double Fumed is the process of fuming the oak lamellas (The top, wear layer of the engineered floorboard) wood under high pressure and for a period of up to 2 weeks. This allows the fuming effect to penetrate totally through the timber. This results in a much darker coloured wood than with normal Fumed, and with total penetration into the wood. 
The Fuming process only works on heart-wood and any naturally occurring sap in the oak will appear much lighter against the darkened areas.
"
Thermo Treated ,"Thermo treatment of oak darkens the wood through its depth by the application of high temperatures (150degC or more) in the absence of air. The cell structure of the wood breaks down and the result is a timber product that is extremely stable to changes in moisture. Ideal for exterior wood cladding.
The final colour depends upon for how long and how hot the treatment process is.  
"
Bleached ,"The process by which a chemical is applied to timber in order to lighten it. Certain hardwoods are bleached by sunlight –e.g. Walnut, Cherry and Oak. 
Woodworks’ bleaching creates an effect allowing different timber types to be colour-lightened whilst still maintaining the natural charm and features. 
"
Washed or Whitewashed ,
Limed or Black Limed ,"Unique to Woodworks is the process of Black Liming. Used to emphasis the grain features and moderate the colour of the reclaimed Burmese Teak.
