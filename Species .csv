Species Name,Species Description
"EUROPEAN OAK 
","European Oak has long been associated with strength and durability. It is an incredibly versatile wood. 
We use Northern French, German and Polish Oak as their cooler climates encourage slower growth. 
Arboriculture is tree farming and these countries have been growing trees for harvesting for 1000’s of years. They have a tree strong culture and a huge amount of expertise in this area. 
We still saw all of our Oak in in the traditional method, this is either called through and through sawn or live sawn. It produces the best mix of grain across your floor including plain sawn, rift sawn, quarter sawn and even some boards with the heart down the middle and quartering either side. 
Grade is an important consideration. An understanding of what is and what is not permitted in each grade is crucial. Knots, sap, colour variation, small and large splits all play a part. 
Rustic, Nature, Prime, Rift, Quarter sawn grades available. Specialist saw cuts are also available and these include both Rift or Quarter Sawn.

"ENGLISH OAK 

ANTIQUE ENGLISH OAK 
","Woodworks runs a special program working with English Oak. As wood people we have many decades of experience and we have a deep appreciation for the materials we work with. This appreciation is most felt in the English Oak we work with. 
English Oak really is the very best Oak in the world, it is different, it is majestic and it means allot to us. It is a privilege to work with and our pact with it is simple – we will make it shine. 
We only work with a few very special logs each year and these logs have to meet a very strict criteria. The need to be very large logs with a diameter of over 1mm, they need to be very long – and they need to be of the finest quality. 
The floors we make out of English Oak are all quarter sawn and this ancient method of sawing Oak, creates not only the most stable cut, but it is also the most beautiful. The grain is so much finer and many of the boards are treated to lovely thick medullary rays that silver across each width. 
The result is a stunning floor, a floor that needs to be understood to be appreciated. Our quarter sawn English Oak floors really are a thing of beauty. 
"
"FRENCH OAK 
","Our French Oak comes from France, and is the unique element in our Aged collection. 
We chose this French Oak for its broad open grain, soft tone and a characterful array of knots & burrs. We traditionally through and through or live saw to produce a great array for grains across your floor. 
Antique plancher du Quercy is the French name for our Aged Oak floors. 
"
"RECLAIMED OAK 
","Reclaimed Oak is known for its historical impact, beauty, stability and strength. It’s also amongst the most sustainable materials available. 
Having been part of projects across the world – be it a pier, a Victorian textile mill, a government building, or a row of terraced houses for example – we reclaim and fully restore our oak before transforming it into a Woodworks floor. 
Originally from old-growth or primeval growth forests. 
"
"ANTIQUE FRENCH OAK 
","France has a long history of Arboriculture with Oak being farmed for 1000’s of years. 
This lead to a refining of the best varieties of Oak for ship building, cask making, joinery and flooring. 
Old French Oak is mystical, it has an ora and an international reputation. To put it simply : French Oak + old age = magical. 
Looking at old Oak is like looking at old maps or drinking old wine – there is so much to explore your sensations are almost over loaded... how was it sawn, what had happened here or there. Wooden nailed, or sometimes no nails at all. 
Watching it come alive as it is restored, seeing its thick patina polish to leather. Yes it is old and it has great history, sometimes many centuries, often less, but this matters less than its beauty. These floors are like old master paintings – old yes, but things of beauty first. 
 
"
"AMERICAN RED OAK 
","Red Oak is a tree native to North America and is an popular choice for furnishings and woodworking across the continent. 
Popular for solid Woodstrip floors in North America. Has a rich autumnal tone but is less durable than its English counterparts.  This tall straight grained Oak grows across the entirety of the United States. It can be accommodated in a broad variety of growing conditions. 
The strong, heavy wood has light to medium brown colours throughout with a straight grain pattern. 
It is prone to larger knots at lower sections of the tree and not just one large branch not higher up as in European Oak. This makes longer, wider widths without large knots difficult to achieve. 
It is less prone to fading due to lack of tanins, that are more predominant in European Oaks. It will also not fume to a darker tones due to a lack of tannins. 

"
"PIPPY BURR OAK 
","Pippy Oak has small distinctive ‘cats paw ’ knots which appear throughout the wood. 
These clusters of small knots are rarely seen in Oak and are a desirable and distinctive feature. 
The clusters range from a few small knots to deep clusters of many knots together. Burrs in Oak are sought after and provide for a more decoration. 
They are formed from the small whiskers that grow on the outside of Oak trees & these burrs are their roots that run deep into the tree. 
"
"ENGLISH YEW 
","English Yew is considered one of the hardest woods of all softwood species and is one of the oldest European trees, ranging from 400-600 years old. 
It is very slow grown with a very high concentration of growth rings per inch. 
The wood is not like other pines as it does not grow with a solid dense trunk. There are lots of gaps, called inclusions in Yew material, making it very difficult to produce long continuous lengths. Orange-brown heartwood with interesting grain patterns across the large proportions. 
It is toxic to ingest and its leaves are used a cure for cancer. 
"
"PITCH PINE /
RECLAIMED PITCH PINE 
","Pitch Pine also known longleaf Pine is a truly remarkable wood. 
Pine has a negative connotation as we think of pine as being something soft, light and of little value. To think of Pitch Pine as being like the pine we know is to truly misunderstand this wood. 
It is more akin to Mahogany – it is a majestic wood. It is harder than Oak, heavier than Mahogany, it is tighter grained and slower grown than any wood we know. It is full of magic resin that glows when you shine a light through it . It has the aroma of the exotic : sweet and sophisticated. 
It is as strong as steel, resistant to decay, woodworm and termites. 
No doubt Native Indians used it’s resin for every manner of medicines, treatments, for preserving, weatherproofing and much else that is long forgotten. 
That’s the best bit and the worst bit..it was mostly all gone over 100 years ago. 
Now a rare wood, an estimated 100 million acres of virgin forest stretching from the Carolinas down to Florida made way for farms, roads, cities and by 1900 it was mostly gone. 
Great Britain was the biggest customer for much of the very best of this material and fortunes were made in North American from this buoyant trade. The only remnants of this wondrous wood are found in the buildings from our built industrial heritage. From the workshops, factories and docklands of our Victorian ancestors. 
When we do find this wonderous wood, the least we can do is respect it for its majesty and make truly wonderful floors out of it. The effort of hauling it, grappling with nails stuck tight to its grain, sawing through what feels like steel. 
The disappointments of wasted wood, bolt holes and all manner of other surprises fall into insignificance when you see the final result. 

Northbank Pitch Pine, Rare Finds 
If a wood could be one of the seven wonders of the world the finest Old Pitch Pine would be it. 
"
"DOUGLAS FIR 
","Named after Peter Douglas who introduced this wood to England in 1827 
Originating from the western coast of Canada. This evergreen pine grows in dense forest areas and has naturalised throughout Europe and South America. 
The tree’s heartwood produces a light pink tone with a wide circling grain pattern, and inside you’ll also find tight growth rings. 
The broad open grain and its neutral appearance once finished is the design appeal for this material. 
It is also important to add that it is not a dense wood. It is much softer than Oak and its density makes it prone to shrinking particularly in a solid format. 
It is also can also be called Columbian Pine or Oregon Pine. 
"
"RECLAIMED SWISS PINE 
","Grown across the Alps, Swiss Pine is a wood that typically experiences the harshest of weathers and coldest of temperatures, making this one of the most resilient woods. 
The tree grows very slowly, living up to 1,000 years, with tight and plentiful growth rings inside the wood. 
"
"RECLAIMED CANADIAN RED PINE 
","Reclaimed Canadian Red Pine 
British Columbian Pine planks contains clearly defined grain patterns. With favoured crown cut boards showing flowery grain down the middle of each board with fine straight grain either side. 
The closely compacted end grain is testament to how slow grown these old growth pines are. It is widely misunderstood how much slower grown these pines are compared to temperate woods like Oak and Ash. 
The newly sawn woods fresh pinky tones bare no comparison to the deep browns of its old patina that has built but over decades. 
"
"ANTIQUE GEORGIAN PINE 
/ 
RECLAIMED GEORGIAN PINE ","The Georgian era spanned from 1714 to 1830. This period saw rapid industrialisation as well the growth of Great Britains reach across the globe. It also marked the rise of a new architectural movement. This was founded on graciously proportioned classical buildings that are marked by an understated elegance. Their pleasing symmetry was in part achieved by applying the golden ratio. 
This architectural style demanded more refined interior spaces and wood floors evolved to meet these requirements. 
Pine floorboards from this era are marked by their refinement – smooth surfaces created through sawing multiple times combined with especially wide widths and lengths make these floors highly sought after. 
The Pine for these floors originated from both the Baltics and from North America. 
 
"
"ENGLISH ELM 
WS12 
ANTIQUE ENGLISH ELM 
","English Elm is strong and durable with a tightly twisted grain. In fresh timber it is full of greens and blues intermingled into the grain, however this quickly fades to a deep tan in older woods. 
New Elm is seldom found in Great Britain due to the effects of Dutch Elm disease. There are a few remaining tracks, with some Wych elm found in the Scottish boarders and the deep red hued Huntington Elm, which has some resistance to the disease is still found across Oxfordshire & Northamptonshire. 
Elm is a very special wood, however its wild and erratic grain patterns combined with more open fibres make it less dimensionally stable than other temperate woods like Oak and Ash. 
Antique Elm floorboards are seldom found and it is very rare to find anything more than very small quantities. 
 
"
"BLACK WALNUT 
","American Black Walnut originates from the Eastern United States, albeit Black Walnut trees are now widely established in Great Britain and across Europe. It’s botanical name is Juglans Nigra and this in contract to the lighter toned English Walnut Julglans Regia. 
Black walnut is easily identifiable due to its unique deep brown tone. Its Heartwood can range from a lighter pale brown to a dark chocolate brown with darker brown streaks. 
When you look closely you can see a grey, purple, or reddish cast. The new growth on the outside of the tree is called sapwood and this is contrasting pale yellow-grey to nearly white tone. 
You will also often see figured grain patterns such as curl, crotch, and burls. Pennsylvania Walnut has the best reputation for the deepest brown tones and the depth of this will fade the further south walnut is harvested from. 
Walnut is less dense than Oak, however it still performs well as a floor. The main decision is around the grade and special consideration needs to be given to the amount of sap and knots you prefer. 
 
"
"ENGLISH/EUROPEAN WALNUT 
","Juglans Regia is the botanical name for a much paler and lighter toned Walnut. This variety is mainly found in Great Britain and France. Some of the largest specimens are found in North Africa especially around the Atlas mountains in Morocco, where the trees are rightfully protected. 
It is a highly prized wood normally reserved for fine furniture and gunstocks. 
This is a very delicate timber with fine grains that contain a kaleidoscope of colours – tans, blacks, creams and even greens all blend together into a soft tone. The grain patterns are always lively with it swirling around like the cosmos. Knots tend to be small and black. 
Walnut is a working tree and produces a large crop of nuts every year. Older trees are prone to storm damage and this is the main source of our English Walnut. This is normally only available in very small quantities. 
"
"EUROPEAN LARCH 

RECLAIMED LARCH 

SIBERIAN LARCH 
","Larches is a native forest tree in Russia, Central Europe, United States and Canada. They require a cool and fairly humid climate and for this reason they are found in the mountains of temperate zones.
It was introduced to Great Britain in the 17th Century and mature trees are now prevalent particularly in Scotland and Northern England.
It is stable, strong and hard. Shrinkage is minimal. It is an incredibly slow grown wood with very tight growth rings. The grain patterns tend to be quite regular with crown saw boards showing a central flowery grain running into straighter grain.
The new timber growth builds on the outside of the tree. This is called sap wood and is a lighter, pale to cream tone.
The knots are black and can be quite numerous, albeit they are normally quite small. The further north the timber comes from the less knots there are as the cold winters kill off the new growth.
The wood can feel quite course and special attention needs to be given to producing a smooth surface.
 "
"RECLAIMED BURMESE TEAK 
","You can tell straight away that you are in the presence of Burmese teak - you smell it. 
It has a lovely deep aroma, and this comes from the incredible oils that are locked up inside this wood. These oils never fade and if anything, they are even stronger in old wood. 
Teak might be known for its incredible durability and water resistance, however it is also a beautiful wood. It has strongly defined grain patterns and a huge range of brown to vanilla tones that blend into one another seamlessly. 
Teak was used widely in Victorian Britain in swimming baths for cubicles, fine joinery in public buildings. It goes without saying that it was also used extensively in boat building. Boats built entirely out of teak where not uncommon with hulls, decks and external structure all made out of Teak. 
We only work with reclaimed Burmese Teak salvaged from 18th and 19th century buildings. These are mainly old floorboards and beams from colonial homes found across south east Asia. We also occasional reclaim old floors from buildings in Great Britain. 
This material is carefully restored and used for flooring, external decks and sawn to size for joinery. 
It would be fair to say that we are specialists in this area and have an archive of one of the largest stocks of reclaimed Teak available in the world today. 
"
"BEECH 
","A very hard and straight-grained wood which is used for everything from flooring to building construction. 
Native to Europe, Asia and North America. Not recommended for use over underfloor heating. 
"
"
AMERICAN ASH 
","American Ash is pale toned, with the new growth, called sapwood varying from white to yellow. The older heartwood is light to dark brown. It sometimes has lighter streaks. 
The contrast between the outer light-coloured white sapwood and inner, darker, even brown heartwood is quite distinct. It is generally straight-grained, however the texture is consistently course. The grain pattern is very distinct with a strong grain contrast between the softer summer growth and hard winter growth rings. The grain patterns are strong and very clearly defined. 
The naturally occurring light brown flecks, or mineral streaks are sometimes referred to as ‘glassworm’, are common in ash and are treated as a natural characteristic, and are not considered as a defect 
Although both Oak and Ash belong to the same category of temperate hardwoods, they differ in the degree of hardness. Surprisingly Ash is considered harder than Oak and as a result is used as it is the wood of choose for tool handles & garden tools. 
It is very similar in grain patterns to Teak as Ash also has quite a coarse grain, this needs extra attention when finishing, especially if a smooth surface is required. 
There is a big visual difference between the higher grades of Ash that are a consistent tone with the lower grades that will contain very brown heartwood and a large contrast in tone across each board. 
"
"ENGLISH ASH 
","The botanical name for English Ash is Fraxinus excelsior. It is interesting to note that both the Old English ‘æsc’ and Latin ‘fraxinus’ were used to mean ‘spear’ . This is the spear wood, chosen for its hardness and suitability as a hunting weapon. 
The newly grown sap wood of ash is normally quite indistinguishable from the heart wood. This ranges in colour from pale cream to light straw, with occasional small black marks that are called mineral streaks. 
Through and through or live sawn boards have an unusual flowery pattern, they look like contours on an ordnance survey map! 
Its very important to note that English Ash trees will often develop a band of darker ‘olive’ coloured wood around their heart. In older trees this can develop to become a large proportion of the heart wood. This creates a large contrast and whilst is it highly desirable for furniture it is a considered choice in a wide plank floor. 
English Ash grows into very large diameters and can be available in very long and wide planks. 
"
"BIRCH 
","The botanical name for birch is Betula pendula. We commonly call it silver birch or European white birch. It is also called East Asian white birch. This is species of tree is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It only grows well in cold climates and in southern Europe, it is only found at higher altitudes. 
It is instantly recognisable as being the lighter type of plywood. It is a pure to creamy-white tone. Sometimes it has pale brown flames. It is demanded due to it being considerably featureless. There is almost no colour separation between sapwood and heartwood. 
We only work with Birch within the engineered construction of our floors. It is classed as a hardwood and is the perfect counterbalance in these floors 
"
"CANADIAN MAPLE 

RECLAIMED CANADIAN MAPLE 
","There are over a hundred different types of maple trees. In fact the Acer trees commonly found in gardens are a type of maple tree. 
The Maple used for wood floors is surprisingly called Hard Maple , it is also called Sugar Maple. 
Hard Maple was the wood of choice for almost all hardwood floors from 1880 to the end of the 20th century. These were made in narrow wood strips. Reclaiming and restoring Maple floors was the mainstay of our business from when started in 1993. 
We are proud to have given hundreds of thousands of square metres of these floors a second life in homes & commercial spaces across Great Britain. Many of these floors are still in use today and are the flag bearer of why hardwood floors are a long life choice. 
Maple is incredibly strong and very hardwearing. Many of the floors we reclaimed had barely worn a few millimetres in decades sometimes centuries of use. The higher grades are an icey white tone with almost no variation in colour. In wider widths and in standard grades you will find more flamey brown streaks. 
Maple stains very well and is dimensionally stable. 
"
"MIXED SPECIES 
","A floor which combines elements from differing species to create a unique effect, look and feel. 
"
"CEDAR 
","Western Red Cedar is renowned for its use a shingles or exterior wall cladding. It weathers to a wonderful silver tone. 
It is highly sought after, being one of the most durable in the world. 
It has an aromatic fragrance which can be retained for long periods of time and it also contains a natural preservative which is resistant to fungal attack. 
The durable wood is easy to work, soft and good for use in construction. It is a special wood and this is reflected in its high price. 
Lebanon of Cedar has similar properties, however it has a much broader grain pattern. 
It is too soft for flooring, however it is perfect for wall cladding. 
"
"IPE/TAJIBO 
","Tajebo is also known as Ipe. It really is a wood of extremes. 
It is extremely dense and and extremely durable, but it is also extremely difficult to work. 
Its incredible hardness and strength make it well suited for flooring applications, in fact they aren’t many wood species that are stronger or harder. 
The colour is very different to temperate woods . The Heartwood can vary in colour from reddish brown to a chocolate brown. It is more accurate to describe as olive brown. 
The grain patterns are contrasting darker brown/black stripes. The grain is straight and regular. 
It is often referred to as being “Brazilian Walnut” although it is not related to true Walnut in the Juglans genus. 
We have worked with the same managed forest in Bolivia for over two decades. Their commitment to sustainable forest managed and adherence to the rigour of FSC certifications provide us some wonderful woods and the re- assurance that they are sourced sustainably. 
Becaus e there is a high risk of illegal or over logging for ipe timber, we will only 
ever supply you with these floors with an FSC certification 
It is ideal for very high traffic areas, it has a unique mid-century feel and it will last for decades and maybe even centuries. 
   
"
"MORADO ROSEWOOD 
","Morado is also known as Santos Rosewood or Bolivian Rosewood. 
This is one of the most delicate and sophisticated woods we work with. It has a great colour range from deep dark browns through to pale vanillas. It also has greens and blue hues running through the grain, however like all great woods all of these tones blend seamlessly together. 
Rosewood is also very hard and durable. It is very slow grow with very tight grain concentrations. 
This is a wood that should be finished to make the natural tones shine and as such we do not recommend staining or other surface treatments. When finished it resembles East Indian Rosewood, although Morado has a greater colour range. 
Rosewood was used extensively and brilliantly by mid-century furniture makers like Robert Heritage, Svend Langkilde, Vittorio Dassi, Ibkofob – Larsen, Harry Rosengren Hansen, Kurt Ostervig and Florence Knoll. 
A Morado Rosewood floor is perfect to either compliment these pieces are to create mid-century foundations in any interior. 
We have worked with the same managed forest in Bolivia for over two decades. Their commitment to sustainable forest managed and adherence to the rigour of FSC certifications provide us some wonderful woods and the re- assurance that they are sourced sustainably. 
There is a high risk of illegal or over logging for Rosewood Morado timber, and we will only ever supply you with these floors with an FSC certification 
"
"JARRAH 
WS22 
RECLAIMED JARRAH 
","Jarrah is only native to South Western Australia. These are the oldest trees in Australia and mature at 380 to 400 years Old. 
The oldest know tree is called the Old Jarrah tree is an exceptionally large and old tree near the entrance at the corner Third Road and Church Avenue in Armadale, Western Australia. It is estimated to be between 400 and 800 years old 
Jarrah is a type of Eucalyptus it is botanical name is Eucalyptus Marginata. 
When newly milled Jarrah has a heartwood colour that ranges from a light red or brown to a darker brick red. Jarrah is very light reactive and it only darkens to its deep browm tones after exposure to light. 
To invest in Jarrah you need to see past the fresh red tones and look forward to it aging to deep brown to black mahogany like tones. 
The sapwood only even very thin and is a pale yellow to pink. 
It has interlocked or wavy grain and the texture can be quite course. Gum pockets or streaks are resin like pockets running in narrow channels down the plank and are aa naturally-occurring defect. 
Quantities of Jarrah were imported to Great Britain in the late 19th century. Records show that it was used on roads and pavement instead of cobblestones as Australian Jarrah proved to be the most durable road surface, being both hard-wearing, and resistant to absorbing horse urine. 
"
"JATOBA 
","Jatoba is a Brazilian tropical wood. It is strong and very hard wearing. It has very subtle grain patterns and appears very even in tone. Often it is referred to as being South American Cherry, however it has not botanical connection and only shares some tonal similarities. 
The heartwood varies from a light brown with orange undertones to a darker reddish brown. It sometimes has contrasting darker grayish brown streaks. 
Like many other tropical hardwoods it is very sunlight reactive and the colour darkens quite quickly, upon exposure to light. The freshly grown aapwood is a light greyish yellow and it is clearly demarcated from the darker heartwood. 
There is a high risk of illegal or over logging for Jatoba timber, so we will only ever supply you with these floors with an FSC certification 
"
"MASSARANDUBA 
","Bulletwood, Massaranduba is also called Bulletwood or Brazilian Red Wood . Its botanical name is Manilkara bidentata and it grows only in South American, mainly in Brazil 
Its heartwood is a medium to dark reddish brown. Like all tropicak hardwoods its colour will darken with age to a much more rich and attractive colour. It has a pale yellow sapwood that is clear defined from the heartwood, 
The grain straight of Massaranduba is interlocked and has lots of small waves. It is quite a dull to matt wood with a fine uniform texture . 
Massuranduba or Bulletwood is an incredibly strong and a very very dense wood . 
Its incredible durability makes it a frequent choice for flooring. 
It has a Janka hardness rating of 3,190 ensures that it will stand up against major impacts. 
There is a high risk of illegal or over logging for Massaranduba timber, so we will only ever supply you with these floors with an FSC certification 
 
"
"PURPLE HEART 
","Purple heart is one of the most unusual woods we have ever worked with. It really is bright purple and that’s without any human interventiom. 
Interestingly when freshly cut the heartwood of Purpleheart is a dull grayish/purplish brown. 
It is only exposure when wood is exposed to light that the wood becomes a deeper, almost aubergine purple. 
It is only with further age and exposure to UV light, that the wood mellows to a dark brown. However it will never lose its rich purple undertones. 
Purpleheart wood is very strong, dense and very very durable. It is so strong it can easily be considered one of the strongest and densest woods available. The downside of all of this hardness and durability is that it makes it very hard to work with. Tools are soon worn out or clogged up. 
The end result makes it more than worth it, the colour is striking and has an unmatched appeal. It is probably the most exotic woods originating from Central and South America. 
Purple heart is a very special wood and as such it is well suited to accents or borders within a patterned floor. The truly adventurous however may opt for Purple Heart acoss the whole floor. 
There is a high risk of illegal or over logging for Purple Heart timber, so we will only ever supply you with these floors with an FSC certification 
  
"
"TIGERWOOD 
","Tigerwood is also called the wonderfully exotic Goncalo Alves. It is a South American Hardwood with a strong personality. 
It is called Tigerwood and this is the first thing that will come into your head when you see it. A tiger could hide amongst this wood and you might struggle to see it. 
It is a stripy wood and it has a striking veins 
The Heartwood is typically a medium reddish brown, but the feature is the irregular streaks of dark brown to black. This look like they could be painted on with a brush as they swoosh down each plank. 
Like all tropical hardwoods the colour will darken with age, to a richer, fuller tone. 
Tigerwood can only be appreciated as a complete floor and its beauty is lost if used as a border or feature detail. 
There is a high risk of illegal or over logging for Tigerwood timber, so we will only ever supply you with these floors with an FSC certification 
 
"
"Sapele 
","Sapele is mainly used for mouldings as stair parts due to its straight grain and consistency. 
Its Heartwood is a golden to dark reddish brown. Its colour tends to darken with age. 
This wood species is not listed in the CITES Appendices,but is on the IUCN Red List. 
It is listed as vulnerable due to a population reduction of over 20% in the past three generations, caused by a decline in its natural habit continous and exploitation. 
This is not a wood that we will work with. 
WS33 
  
"
"Wenge 
","Interestingly this is usually pronounced WHEN-gii or WHEN-ghay, 
This is an incredibly sought after African hardwood and has excellent strength and hardness properties. It’s much more frequently called by it botanical name of Millettia Laurentii 
Wenge wood is an exotic timber species and it is only harvested from the Central and West Africa. It has a very unique visual appearance. It is a dark on dark wood with a heartwood that is medium brown and nearly brown to black fine streaks. This combination is striking. Careful finishing is required, particularly with oils as the wood can easily become nearly black. 
It is very important to note that unlike most other dark hardwoods, the heartwood of wenge can lighten (rather than darken) when exposed to sunlight. The best example of this is in the DeBeers store on the corner of Bond st and Regent st in London, where the Wenge floors in the window are now almost blond in tone. 
This wood species is not listed in the CITES Appendices, but is on the IUCN Red List. It is listed as endangered due to a population reduction of over 50% in the past three generations, caused by a decline in its natural range, and exploitation. 
We only supply this material from reclaimed stocks that we have built up over the last 3 decades. It works especially well as an inset border in patterned or parquetry floors. 
For wide plank & herringbone & Chevron floors requiring this tone we have developed a toolbox of fuming skills that enable sustainably sourced temperate woods to replicate the deep brown tones of Wenge. For further information please see our Double Fumed and Deep fumed floors .
