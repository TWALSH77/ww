Edge Detail Name,Edge Detail Description
"Square Edges 
","Square-shoulder or square edged flooring can only be supplied in an unfinished state. If we workshop finish a floor without any edge details, after installation there will be lips (a step) between each element. and Experience has taught us that this is unacceptable.  
A square edge floor is required to be site sanded prior to finishing. It will then give the appearance of a seamless smooth , floor with flat joints between the planks or pieces. Square edge hand finishesd wall cladding can be provided 
, where lips are acceptable.

"Soft Rolled Edges 
","This detail aims to bring a Woodworks hand finished floor as near as possible to a bevel free, site finished floor. Very soft rolled edges ease the junction between each element in the floor. These are organic and vary gently, however they give the floor a very relaxed and natural feel. This allows you to access all of the specialties of a hand finished floor, whilst maintaining a similar feel to a site finished floor. 
"
"Hand Rolled Edges 
","This is much more pronounced that soft rolled edges. This method makes each element in the floor, appear far more pronounced. It has the feel of the edges having lightly worn over time.  A traditional method is used to round every edge of planks, herringbone and chevrons - it is all done by hand. The skill is in using varying degrees of force to shape into a continuous, but random edge. Because the wood will vary in hardness along the edge, and because the detail is applied by hand, the result is a slightly irregular, very natural looking rounded edge detail between the planks. This is much less uniform and more pleasing on the eye than machine applied micro bevels. Rolling the internal edges of design panels like Parquet du Versailles, Chantilly and Sapphire requires a totally different manufacturing process and is Only available a s a bespoke order with a significant price uplift. 
"
"Micro Bevel 
","The edge of the board is angled to create a small V groove, which appears when the boards or blocks are laid together. The bevel more clearly defines the edge and gives a sharp distinction between elements. Our standard bevel is a micro bevel of 2mm before sanding, machined on all 4 sides of each element. Larger bevels can be produced by request. Bevelling on just the long edges ( 2sides ) can also be produced by request on planks. In Hand finished floors, this has the risk of lipping on the ends of each plank where there is no bevel, but the benefit of the planks feeling more continuous in length. 
"
"Internal Panel Pattern Rolled Edges 
","Each internal component within a panel is hand-rolled to provide a subtle edge that highlights the pattern and movement of the flooring. This is a highly complex undertaking as each element needs to be rolled prior to the panel being assembled. 
"
Internal Panel Pattern Beveled ,"The internal components within a panel are bevelled to provide crisp modern tailored finish on each shape of a pattern floor. This is a complex process and this design is only made to order.
